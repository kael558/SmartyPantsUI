## ü§î What is this?
An integrated development environment to speed up front-end development.

A user can view their development server through the development environment to gain access to features.

## üìñ Getting Started 
### ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Install
Clone the project to your desired folder with:
`git clone https://github.com/kael558/SmartyPantsUI.git`

### ‚õìÔ∏è Run the Langflows
Download the 4 langflows and populate the API keys/applications secrets.

These are now an API that you can call from your local machine.

### ü§ñ Running a Local Development Server
Navigate to the templates folder and open 'my-app' for a good first example. 

Make sure to run `npm i` and then `npm start` to spin up the local development server.

### üìÅ Start up the Development Environment
Navigate back to the root of the project.

Do the same and run `npm i` and then `npm start` 

Copy your path from the Local Development Server and paste it in the project_dir, so that the environment knows where the files are. 

By this point you should have:
- Langflow running with 4 langflow endpoints
- A local development server running the React starter template
- The development environment

The current main features in the Development Environment are:
- Clicking on the UI and seeing the retrieved source code. You can make edits and save that code to see live updates in the UI.
- After a component is selected, you may type in the text input and:
  - Request an edit (e.g., changing the text/styling) and then clicking 'Edit'
  - Add a new component (e.g., add a Greeting component that says "Hello world") and then clicking 'Add New' which will create new component files
- You may publish a component so it is saved in the vector database and accessible by search. The purpose of this is:
  - So a user can easily select and find components in their project
  - It is also for a future feature to allow re-use of existing components instead of always creating new ones
